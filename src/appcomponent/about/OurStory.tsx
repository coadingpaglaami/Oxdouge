        <p>
          Not Overland was born from a simple frustration: outdoor enthusiasts
          needed reliable power for their adventures, but existing solutions
          were either too heavy, too expensive, or simply unreliable when it
          mattered most.
        </p>
        <p>
          Founded in 2018 by a group of backcountry adventurers and engineers in
          Boulder, Colorado, we set out to change that. Our mission was clear:
          create portable power solutions that don{"'"}t compromise on capacity,
          portability, or sustainability.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, Not Overland serves thousands of outdoor enthusiasts across
          North Americaâ€”from weekend campers to full-time overlanders to
          emergency preparedness experts. Every power station and solar panel we
          design goes through rigorous field testing in real conditions,
          ensuring it delivers when you need it most.
